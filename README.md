## Gears
For the show drive train, the input rotational sped is 3600min $^{-1}$, and the number of teeth of the sprocket is $z_1 = 20$. Ease note: $n_2 = n_3,\ n_4 = n_5,\ n_6 = n_7$.

The number of teeth of the sprockets are:
$z_1 = 20,\ z_2 = 45,\ z_3 = 24,\ z_4 = 55,\ z_5 = 30,\ z_6 = 43,\ z_7 = 15,\ z_8 = 58$

Calculate the rotational speed in min$^{-1}$ for the final sprocket $z_8$ where the driveshafts are mounted. Round to one decimal.

$$n_1 = 3600 1/$$min
