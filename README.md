## Gears
For the show drive train, the input rotational sped is 3600min $^{-1}$, and the number of teeth of the sprocket is $z_1 = 20$. ease note: $n_2 = n_3,\, n_4 = n_5,\, n_6 = n_7$.

The number of teeth of the sprockets are:
$z_1 = 20,\, z_2 = 45,\, z_3 = 24,\, z_4 = 55,\, z_5 = 30,\, z_6 = 43,\, z_7 = 15,\, z_8 = 58$
